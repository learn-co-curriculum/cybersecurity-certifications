# Certifcations are worth it!

If you’ve spent any time within or around the cybersecurity industry, you’ve undoubtedly heard of cybersecurity certifications. CEH, CISM, CompTIA Security+, and CISSP are just a few of the certs that you’ll often find filling the resumes of highly successful cybersecurity professionals. Most industry veterans will tell you that certifications can be a crucial part of your career development, but are they really worth the time and money? The easy answer: yes, they are definitely worth it. 

Skeptical? Whether you’re looking to break into the industry or you’re preparing for your next career move, there’s an ongoing list as to why you should be earning cyber certs. Below, we’re giving you our top five reasons for how certs can benefit you, as well as the quickest and most efficient way for you to earn them. 

**Your Leg-up on the Competition**

It’s no secret that the cybersecurity industry is facing a tremendous shortfall of professionals; career-ready talent is in high-demand right now. But this doesn’t mean that securing a role as a cyber professional is a cakewalk. Even with position vacancies, the field remains extremely competitive and organizations continue to seek the most qualified candidates to fulfill their roles. Put simply, certifications put you ahead of your competition. Not only will you make it farther in the HR screening process, but in many cases, your certs can be a major deciding factor in getting hired. According to Burning Glass, over a third of cybersecurity roles ask for a certification. As a general rule, if it comes down to you and another candidate with equal experience, whoever holds the cert will land the job.

Imagine that you are a SOC analyst, and you’re applying for a role as a pen tester. While you have some cybersecurity experience, it may not be 100% applicable to pen testing. How do you compete with those who already have ethical hacking experience? The answer: by earning your Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification. This certification proves to hiring managers that you are familiar with vulnerabilities, attack vectors, cryptography and several more concepts involving pen testing. No matter what cybersecurity role you’re pursuing, certs will always give you the upper-hand. 

If you want to see which certifications are requested for specific cyber careers, check out the Cybersecurity Career Pathway tool at Cyberseek.org. Not only can you see which certs can help you land specific roles, but you can also get an idea of what skills you’ll need to get each job done. 

**Career Advancement**

You may be on your boss’ good side and you may be having a productive year in your current role, but if you’re looking for a promotion, the right certifications is your best bet. Certifications considerably increase your chances of landing more advanced roles. The CISSP for example, is a certification that you’ll find under the belts of a majority of CISOs and Directors of Security. In many instances, the right certification comes with the territory. Certifications can also help you qualify for adjacent roles in the industry, allowing you to alter your career trajectory more easily. The bottom line is that the more you continue to develop your cyber credentials through certifications, the more options you’ll have throughout your cybersecurity career. 

**A Bigger Paycheck**

Certification achievement can often be followed up by a significant salary bump upon completion. If you’re getting ready to enter the industry, certifications can give you extra wiggle room when negotiating your entry-level salary. Cybersecurity veterans can see significant increases in their salaries with the right certifications. In 2016, a survey conducted by (ISC)² found that cyber-professionals who possess their globally recognized, CISSP certification, reported an average annual salary of $97,778, while uncertified professionals reported an average of $76,363 per year. That’s just a few dollars shy of a $20,000 difference, based solely on the possession of one certification.

**Universal Skill Validation**

Whether you’re involved in our highly-effective, immersive programs, or you’ve chosen the path of traditional education, one thing is certain, you will have to prove your level of expertise when interviewing for a role in cyber. Not every employer will be familiar with the school you have attended, so demonstrating your skillset is a must. On the other hand, an industry-recognized certification speaks for itself. For example, obtaining the CompTIA Security+ certification will show employers that you possess a highly-desired level of expertise in cybersecurity foundations. Certifications will instill confidence in those looking to hire you, and they can help to do a lot of the talking in the interview process.  

**A DoD “Must-have”**

If your goal is to work for the government in a cybersecurity capacity, you’ll need to have the right certifications. The Department of Defense for example, follows directive DoDD 8140 when hiring candidates. This directive outlines the minimum requirements for DoD cyber roles, including non-negotiable certifications. In other words, if you’re not certified, you’re not working for the DoD; end of story. Without meeting these minimum certification requirements, your job application won’t even be considered for these roles. You can find more specifics at SANS or through directly researching DoDD 8140. The certification that you’ll want to pursue is highly dependant on the kind of government role you’re interested in.

**CompTia Security**. CompTIA Security+ is the first security certification IT professionals should earn. It establishes the core knowledge required of any cybersecurity role and provides a springboard to intermediate-level cybersecurity jobs. The certification emphasizes the practical and hands-on ability to both identify and address security threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities. CompTIA Security+ is a globally trusted, vendor-neutral certification that validates the baseline skills necessary to perform core security functions and pursue an IT security career.

**ISO27001**. ISO/IEC 27001 is an information security standard, part of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, of which the last version was published in 2013, with a few minor updates since then.[1] It is published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) under the joint ISO and IEC subcommittee. 

**ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27**  ISO/IEC 27001 specifies a management system that is intended to bring information security under management control and gives specific requirements. Organizations that meet the requirements may be certified by an accredited certification body following successful completion of an audit.
